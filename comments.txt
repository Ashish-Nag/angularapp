directives in angular: 

    1> if directive : ngIf, a basic if else statement could be written in angular following similar patterns as shown in ABOUT COMPONENT of this project.

    2> switch directive : ngSwitch, switch case statements also could be written in angular, as shown in the ABOUT COMPONENT of the project.
        we use [ngSwitch]='<variable name>' as an attribute of the html element. 
        and then we use *ngSwitchCase = "'<cases>'" as attribute of html element to check for cases.

    3> for of : ngFor is used to iterate over an array or an object to create a tempalate, as shown in the ABOUT COMPONENT of the project. 
        we use *ngFor = "let <variable> of <array/object defined in .ts file>" as an attribute of the html element, and inside that element we use {{<variable>}} for data interpolation. 


Services: 
    angular Services are the way to manipulate data across the whole angular application
    
    We use import and export keywords to send data of a service to application components

    Services are the bridges between backend, api, databases and the front-end angular applications.

    "ng g service" is the command for creating services.

HttpClient Library: 

    - As angular is a front-end framework so for the back-end, we mostly need to use the HttpClient library.
    - It fetches the data over the http from api/back-end and makes it available for the angular front-end application via angular services.
